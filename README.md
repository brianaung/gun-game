## Teamwork plan/summary

<!-- [[StartTeamworkPlan]] PLEASE LEAVE THIS LINE UNTOUCHED -->

<!-- Fill this section by Milestone 1 (see specification for details) -->

Here you should be discussing how you will be delegating tasks among team members, as well
as protocols and processes you will use to keep the project organised. Keep it updated 
throughout the duration of the project. By the final submission it should contain 
a summary of who completed what. (You should of course remove and replace this paragraph!)

- Ian: camera view
  - third person, camera movement, camera collision
- Ian: player input
  - character movement 
  - jumping/double jump, dashing (mid-air/ground), strafing
- Ian: UI elements (health and ammo) + game controller ()
- Ian: jump particle effect
- Ian: Audio for guns and menu
- Ian: Ui elements/buttons for menu 
- Harry: weapon system: AK47/Firethrower
  - right click to shoot, press "R" to reload, press "1" or "2" to swich weapon, move mouse to trun character around
  - fire gun: it is implement with fire particle system. 
  - rifle
  - Decision making:
    - weapn only move in horizontal line

  - weapon damage
- Harry: particle system
  - flame comming through fire gun, blood animation
- Jun: enemy system
  - hide in the corner of maze and pop up suddenly
  - projectile collision
  - enemy movement
  - enemy spawn rate
- Brian: environment
  - cel shading to have an cartoonish effect
  - Rooms, procedurally generated (room size, enemies spawn rate, objects within the room)

### Game Summary
Gun Game is a game where you play as capsule man going through a dungeon and killing other capsule men and then eventually ending up fighting a giant amogus after 20 kills.

### How to play the game
The game uses fairly stand mouse and keyboard inputs, WASD to move the player around, left mouse button to shoot, moving the mouse moves the camera around the player space to jump, r to reload and the numbers 1 and 2 allow you to switch to the corresponding two weapons. When the game first loads you are taken to a menu screen where you can press start to play or press controls to look over the controls or the credits to look at the credits.

### Gameplay design decisions

### Level design
The biggest design decision we made is how the level is going to be like. We knew we wanted an shooter game in the third person and so an arena first came to mind. However, an area would be a bit too basic and we wanted to include some procedural generation for the level, and so we thought of doing a maze of some kind. Whilst this would work, mazes tend to be quite small as its just a bunch of corridors. We eventually came up with the idea of procedurally generating rooms and connecting them with corridors. This gives us much more space to decorate the rooms with objects and larger rooms give the player more freedom of movement.

### Player and Camera controls
The next gameplay decision was how the player is going to be controlled. We opted for the standard mouse and keyboard controls, WASD, space, left mouse button, etc., as that is what most shooter games use. We could have added a controller option however we thought mouse and keyboard controls were best due to the accuracy of a mouse would fit the game much better than controller thumb sticks.

Another thing we had to consider is making the game with a first person perspective or third person perspective. Whilst the game can work with a first person perspective and easier as dealing with camera collision makes the camera movement a bit more complicated, making the game third person, gives the player a larger field of view allowing the player to see enemies on the sides more easily, making for a better gameplay experience.

Another design related decision that needs to be made in regards to the camera is how it is going to collide with the objects around it. An early implementation of camera collision was to check slighly behind the camera for objects, however, when using the position of the camera, as a start point of a linecast. Something like this,
``` C#
if(Physics.Linecast(camTransform.position + offset, camTransform.position - offset, out var hit))
{
  transform.position = hit.point;
}
 
```
will make the camera stick to the wall. This can be patched with checking if the player's distance from the camera gets to large than the camera will move to its normal position, however, that is only janky patch and not actually a fix as the gameplay experience isn't that great as the camera will suddenly move forwards.

Eventually we ended up going for a more simple route, which is just checking for objects between the player and camera. However, since the player is also an object we must include a slight offset so the linecast avoids the player. Something like this
``` C#
  if(Physics.Linecast(playerTransform.position - offset, camTransform.position, out var hit))
  {
      camtransform.position = hit.point;
  }
```
Whilst this isn't a perfect solution, enemies or objects when close enough can mess with the camera position, it is a solution that works well enough and was easily implemented.

### Code Snippets 

You may wish to include code snippets, but be sure to explain them properly, and don't go overboard copying
every line of code in your project!

```c#
public class CameraController : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start ()
    {
        // Do something...
    }
}
```
